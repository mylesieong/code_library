# Overview of AI
## Game playing
Game playing studies that interaction among more than 1 agent.
Famous algorithm are: 
* Minimax decision 
* Iterative Deepening
### Problem to be solved
Assume every player plays perfectly, and the information is complete and static
## State Search
State search is a very generic topic, state statement can apply to lots of practical problem in real life such as ""Trip Planning"",  ""Sudoku/puzzle solving"", ""Finding best strategy"" and a lot more. 
Famous algorithm are:
* BFS/ DFS 
* BFS+ (Uniform cost search)
* A star search
### Problem to be solving
When there are local max, search algorithm will be trapped so we might introduce random algorithm.
